# P2P-communication-between-nodes
This is my first time try to understand how communication can happen between peers in a network. How they communicate date with one another and how broadcasts happen in a Blockchain network using node js
to run the program

Step 1: Run the p2p.js file on cmd
Step 2: copy the  return Address
Step 3: run the same p2p.js file prompt on cmd in another system (same network) or window.
Step 4: the link is established between peers
Warning : there exisits a time element in this project. after 30seconds of no communication between peers. the link is dissovled or deleted from the memory.
